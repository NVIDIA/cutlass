# Overview

# CUTLASS 4.1.0

_CUTLASS 4.1.0 - July 2025_

CUTLASS is a collection of abstractions for implementing high-performance matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM)
and related computations at all levels and scales within CUDA. It incorporates strategies for
hierarchical decomposition and data movement. CUTLASS decomposes these "moving parts" into reusable, modular
software components and abstractions.

Primitives for different levels of a conceptual parallelization hierarchy can be specialized and tuned
via custom tiling sizes, data types, and other algorithmic policy. The resulting flexibility simplifies
their use as building blocks within custom kernels and applications.

CUTLASS has been providing CUDA C++ template abstractions for high-performance linear algebra since 2017 and
these abstractions provide extensive support for a wide range of computations including
mixed-precision computations, specialized data-movement (async copy) and
multiply-accumulate abstractions for FP64, FP32, TF32, FP16, BF16,
[FP32 emulation via tensor core instruction](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/tree/main/examples/27_ampere_3xtf32_fast_accurate_tensorop_gemm),
 8b floating point types (e5m2 and e4m3),
 block scaled data types (NVIDIA NVFP4 and OCP standard MXFP4, MXFP6, MXFP8),
 narrow integer types (4 and 8b signed and unsigned integers),
 and binary 1b data types (where architectures allow for the
native support of such data types) across NVIDIA's Volta, Turing, Ampere, Ada, Hopper, and Blackwell architectures.

To this rich ecosystem of C++ based kernel programming abstractions, CUTLASS 4 adds CUTLASS DSLs. These are Python native interfaces for writing high-performance CUDA kernels based on core CUTLASS and CuTe concepts without any performance compromises. This allows for a much smoother learning curve, orders of magnitude faster compile times, native integration with DL frameworks without writing glue code, and much more intuitive metaprogramming that does not require deep C++ expertise.

Overall we envision CUTLASS DSLs as a family of domain-specific languages (DSLs). With the release of 4.0, we are releasing the first of these in CuTe DSL. This is a low level programming model that is fully consistent with CuTe C++ abstractions — exposing core concepts such as layouts, tensors, hardware atoms, and full control over the hardware thread and data hierarchy.

CuTe DSL demonstrates optimal matrix multiply and other linear algebra operations
targeting the programmable, high-throughput _Tensor Cores_ implemented by
NVIDIA's Ampere, Hopper, and Blackwell architectures.

We believe it will become an indispensable tool for students, researchers, and performance
engineers alike — flattening the learning curve of GPU programming, rapidly prototyping kernel
designs, and bringing optimized solutions into production.

CuTe DSL is currently in public beta and will graduate out of beta by end of summer 2025.

# Performance

CUTLASS primitives are very efficient.  When used to construct device-wide GEMM kernels,
they exhibit nearly optimal utilization of peak theoretical throughput. The figure below
shows CUTLASS 3.8's performance as a % of theoretical peak utilization
on various input and output data types when run on NVIDIA Blackwell SM100 architecture GPU.

![ALT](media/images/cutlass-3.8-blackwell-gemm-peak-performance.svg "")

The two figures below show the continual CUTLASS performance improvements
on an [NVIDIA H100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/) (NVIDIA Hopper architecture) since
CUTLASS 3.1.
CUTLASS 3.5.1 was compiled with the [CUDA 12.5u1 Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
Tensor Core operations are implemented using CUDA's
[mma](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#warp-level-matrix-instructions-mma) and
[wgmma](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-instructions) instructions.

# CuTe

CUTLASS 3.0 introduced a new core library, CuTe, to describe and manipulate tensors of threads and data.
CuTe is a collection of C++ CUDA template abstractions for
defining and operating on hierarchically multidimensional layouts of threads and data.
CuTe provides `Layout` and `Tensor` objects that compactly package the type,
shape, memory space, and layout of data, while performing the complicated indexing for the user.
This lets programmers focus on the logical descriptions of their algorithms while
CuTe does the mechanical bookkeeping for them. With these tools, we can quickly design,
implement, and modify all dense linear algebra operations.

The core abstractions of CuTe are hierarchically multidimensional layouts
which can be composed with data arrays to represent tensors.
The representation of layouts is powerful enough to represent nearly
everything we need to implement efficient dense linear algebra.
Layouts can also be combined and manipulated via functional composition, on which we build a large set of common operations such as tiling and partitioning.

CUTLASS 3.0 and beyond adopts CuTe throughout the GEMM hierarchy in its templates.
This greatly simplifies the design and improves code composability and readability.
More documentation specific to CuTe can be found in its
[dedicated documentation directory](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/media/docs/cpp/cute/00_quickstart.html).

# Compatibility

Minimum requirements:

- Architecture: Volta (compute capability 7.0)
- Compiler: Must support at least C++17
- CUDA Toolkit version: 11.4

CUTLASS requires a C++17 host compiler and
performs best when built with the [**CUDA 12.8 Toolkit**](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
It is also compatible with CUDA 11.4, CUDA 11.5, CUDA 11.6, CUDA 11.7, CUDA 11.8, and all other CUDA 12.x versions.

## Operating Systems

We have tested the following environments.

|**Operating System** | **Compiler** |
|-----------------|----------|
| Ubuntu 18.04 | GCC 7.5.0  |
| Ubuntu 20.04 | GCC 10.3.0 |
| Ubuntu 22.04 | GCC 11.2.0 |

Note: GCC 8.5.0 has known regressions regarding fold expressions and overloaded operators. Using GCC 7.5.0 or (preferred) GCC >= 9 is recommended.

Note: CUTLASS 3.x builds are known to be down on Windows platforms for all CUDA toolkits.
CUTLASS team is working on a fix.

## Hardware

CUTLASS runs successfully on the following NVIDIA GPUs, and it is expected to be efficient on Volta, Turing, Ampere, Ada, and Hopper architecture based NVIDIA GPUs.

|**GPU**|**CUDA Compute Capability**|**Minimum CUDA Toolkit Required by CUTLASS-3**|
|---|---|---|

|NVIDIA B200 Tensor Core GPU            |10.0|12.8|
|NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50x0 series         |10.0|12.8|

## Target Architecture

In general, PTX code generated for one target architecture can be run on future architectures
(i.e., it is forward compatible).
However, CUDA 12.0 introduced the concept of "architecture-accelerated features" whose
PTX does not have forward compatibility guarantees.
Several Hopper and Blackwell PTX instructions fall under this category of
architecture-accelerated features, and thus require a `sm_90a` or `sm100a` target architecture
(note the "a" appended). For more details on this and other architecture-accelerated instructions,
please refer to the [CUDA Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#feature-availability).

The target architecture information is passed on to CUTLASS via the cmake flag
`CUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS`. In order to maximize performance on Hopper GH100,
users are required to build CUTLASS with `90a` as the target architecture.
If a user accidentally builds a kernel which uses SM90a features
(e.g. Hopper Tensor Core Instructions), using the SM90 target
(note the lack of "a"), with either CUDA Toolkit 12 or 11.8,
the kernel is expected to fail with a runtime error.

```
cmake .. -DCUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS="90a"
```
Or

```
cmake .. -DCUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS="100a"
```

Note: The NVIDIA Blackwell SM100 architecture used in the datacenter
products has a different compute capability than the one underpinning
NVIDIA Blackwell GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs. As a result, kernels
compiled for Blackwell SM100 architecture with arch conditional features
(using `sm100a`) are not compatible with RTX 50 series GPUs.

Please refer to the [functionality documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/media/docs/cpp/functionality.html)
for details on which kernels require which target architectures.

# Building CUTLASS

CUTLASS is a header-only template library and does not need to be built to be used by other
projects. Client applications should target CUTLASS's `include/` directory in their include
paths.

CUTLASS unit tests, examples, and utilities can be build with CMake.
The minimum version of CMake is given in the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/media/docs/cpp/quickstart.html).
Make sure the `CUDACXX` environment  variable points to NVCC in the CUDA Toolkit installed
on your system.

```bash
$ export CUDACXX=${CUDA_INSTALL_PATH}/bin/nvcc
```

Create a build directory within the CUTLASS project, then run CMake. By default CUTLASS will build kernels
for CUDA architecture versions 5.0, 6.0, 6.1, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.6, 8.9, and 9.0.
To reduce compile time you can specify
the architectures to build CUTLASS for by changing the CMake configuration setting
`CUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS`.

```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build

$ cmake .. -DCUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS=80               # compiles for NVIDIA's Ampere Architecture
```

From the `build/` directory, compile and run the CUTLASS unit tests by building the target `test_unit` with make.

The unit tests are organized as several binaries mirroring the top-level namespaces of CUTLASS,
and they may be executed in parallel via make's `-j` command line argument.

```bash
$ make test_unit -j
...
...
...
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 946 tests from 57 test cases ran. (10812 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 946 tests.
```

All tests should pass on supported platforms, though the exact number of tests may vary over time.


# Project Structure

CUTLASS is arranged as a header-only library along with Utilities, Tools, Examples, and unit tests.
[Doxygen documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cutlass) provides a complete list of files, classes,
and template concepts defined in the CUTLASS project.

A detailed explanation of the source code organization may be found in the
[CUTLASS documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/media/docs/cpp/code_organization.html), but several main components are summarized below.

## CUTLASS Template Library

```

### Test

The `test/unit/` directory consist of unit tests implemented with Google Test that demonstrate
basic usage of Core API components and complete tests of the CUTLASS GEMM computations.

Instructions for building and running the Unit tests are described in the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cutlass/media/docs/cpp/quickstart.html).

# Performance Profiling

The `tools/profiler/` directory contains a command-line utility for launching each of the GEMM kernels.
It can be built as follows:

```bash
$ make cutlass_profiler -j16
```
## Building all GEMM and Convolution kernels (_long_ build times)

By default, only one tile size is instantiated for each data type, math instruction, and layout.
To instantiate all, set the following environment variable when running CMake from an empty `build/` directory.
Beware, this results in *tens of thousands* of kernels and long build times.
This would also result in a large binary size and on some platforms linker to fail on building the library.
Therefore, it's highly recommended to generate only a subset of kernels as demonstrated in the sub-section below.
```bash
$ cmake .. -DCUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS=90a -DCUTLASS_LIBRARY_KERNELS=all
...
$ make cutlass_profiler -j16
```

## Building a subset of GEMM and Convolution kernels (_reduced_ build times)

To compile strictly one kernel or a small set of kernels, a comma-delimited list of kernel names with
wildcard characters may be used to reduce the set of kernels. The following examples show building exactly one
or a subset of kernels for NVIDIA Ampere and Turing architecture:

### Building a subset Tensor Core GEMM kernels

To compile a subset of Tensor Core GEMM kernels with FP32 accumulation and FP16 input targeting NVIDIA Ampere and Turing architecture,
use the below cmake command line:
```bash
$ cmake .. -DCUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS='75;80' -DCUTLASS_LIBRARY_KERNELS=cutlass_tensorop_s*gemm_f16_*_nt_align8
...
$ make cutlass_profiler -j16
```

Example command line for profiling a subset of Tensor Core GEMM kernels is as follows:
```bash
./tools/profiler/cutlass_profiler --kernels=cutlass_tensorop_s*gemm_f16_*_nt_align8 --m=3456 --n=4096 --k=4096

### Building a subset of Tensor Core Convolution kernels

To compile a subset of Tensor core convolution kernels implementing forward propagation (fprop) with FP32 accumulation
and FP16 input targeting NVIDIA Ampere and Turing architecture, use the below cmake command line:
```bash
$ cmake .. -DCUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS='75;80' -DCUTLASS_LIBRARY_KERNELS=cutlass_tensorop_s*fprop_optimized_f16
...
$ make cutlass_profiler -j16
```

Example command line for profiling a subset of Tensor Core convolution kernels is as follows:

```bash
$ ./tools/profiler/cutlass_profiler --kernels=cutlass_tensorop_s*fprop_optimized_f16 --n=8 --h=224 --w=224 --c=128 --k=128 --r=3 --s=3
