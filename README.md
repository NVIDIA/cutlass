# CUTLASS 2.0

_CUTLASS 2.0 - November 2019_

CUTLASS is a collection of CUDA C++ template abstractions for implementing
high-performance matrix-multiplication (GEMM) at all levels and scales within CUDA.
It incorporates strategies for hierarchical decomposition and data movement similar
to those used to implement cuBLAS.  CUTLASS decomposes these "moving parts" into
reusable, modular software components abstracted by C++ template classes.  These
thread-wide, warp-wide, block-wide, and device-wide primitives can be specialized
and tuned via custom tiling sizes, data types, and other algorithmic policy. The
resulting flexibility simplifies their use as building blocks within custom kernels
and applications.

To support a wide variety of applications, CUTLASS provides extensive support for
mixed-precision computations, providing specialized data-movement and
multiply-accumulate abstractions for half-precision floating
point (FP16), single-precision floating point (FP32), double-precision floating
point (FP64) types, integer data types (4b and 8b), and binary data types (1b). 
Furthermore, CUTLASS demonstrates warp-synchronous matrix multiply operations for 
targeting the  programmable, high-throughput _Tensor Cores_ implemented by 
NVIDIA's Volta and Turing architectures.

See the [Quick Start Guide](/media/docs/quickstart.md) to get started quickly.

# What's New in CUTLASS 2.0

CUTLASS 2.0 is a substantial refactoring from the previous version, intended to offer:

- Better performance over 1.x, particularly for kernels targeting Turing Tensor Cores
- Robust and durable templates that reliably span the design space
- Encapsulated functionality that may be reusable in other contexts

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more details.

See the [functionality listing](media/docs/functionality.md) for the list of operations
supported at each level of the execution model hierarchy.

# Performance

<p align="center"><img src=/media/images/cutlass-performance-plot.png></p>

CUTLASS primitives are very efficient.  When used to construct device-wide GEMM kernels,
they exhibit performance comparable to cuBLAS for scalar GEMM
computations. The above figure shows CUTLASS performance relative to cuBLAS
for large matrix dimensions on an NVIDIA GeForce 2080 Ti and an NVIDIA TitanV
using CUDA 10.2. Tensor Core operations are implemented using CUDA's 
[mma instruction](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/index.html#warp-level-matrix-instructions-mma).

# Compatibility

CUTLASS requires a C++11 host compiler and 
performs best when built with the [CUDA 10.2 Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit).
It is compatible with CUDA 9.2, CUDA 10.0, and CUDA 10.1.

We have tested the following environments.

|**Operating System** | **Compiler** |
|-----------------|----------|
| Windows 10      | Microsoft Visual Studio 2015|
|                 | Microsoft Visual Studio 2017|
| Ubuntu 16.04 | GCC 5.4.0 |
| Ubuntu 18.04 | GCC 7.3.0 |

Additionally, CUTLASS may be built with clang. 
See [these instructions](media/docs/quickstart.md#clang) for more details.

CUTLASS runs successfully on the following NVIDIA GPUs, and it is expected to be efficient on
any Maxwell-, Pascal-, Volta-, or Turing- architecture NVIDIA GPU.

|**GPU**|**Minimum CUDA Toolkit**|**CUDA Toolkit Enabling Native Tensor Cores**|
|---|---|---|
|NVIDIA GeForce 1080|9.2|  |
|NVIDIA TitanXP|9.2|  |
|NVIDIA Tesla P100|9.2|  |
|NVIDIA Tesla V100|9.2|10.1|
|NVIDIA TitanV|9.2|10.1|
|NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 TI, 2080, 2070|10.0|10.2|
|NVIDIA Tesla T4|10.0|10.2|

# Building CUTLASS

CUTLASS is a header-only template library and does not need to be built to be used by other
projects. Client applications should target CUTLASS's `include/` directory in their include
paths.

CUTLASS unit tests, examples, and utilities can be build with CMake starting version 3.12. 
Make sure the `CUDACXX` environment  variable points to NVCC in the CUDA Toolkit installed
on your system.

```
$ export CUDACXX=${CUDA_INSTALL_PATH}/bin/nvcc
```

Create a build directory within the CUTLASS project, then run CMake. By default CUTLASS will build kernels
for CUDA architecture versions 5.0, 6.0, 6.1, 7.0 and 7.5. To reduce compile time you can specify
the architectures to build CUTLASS for by changing the CMake configuration setting
`CUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS`.

```
$ mkdir build && cd build

$ cmake .. -DCUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS=75               # compiles for NVIDIA's Turing GPU architecture
```

From the `build/` directory, compile and run the CUTLASS unit tests by building the target `test_unit` with make.

The unit tests are organized as several binaries mirroring the top-level namespaces of CUTLASS,
and they may be executed in parallel via make's `-j` command line argument.

```
$ make test_unit -j
...
...
...
[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 946 tests from 57 test cases ran. (10812 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 946 tests.
```

All tests should pass on supported platforms, though the exact number of tests may vary over time.


# Project Structure

CUTLASS is arranged as a header-only library along with Utilities, Tools, Examples, and unit tests. 
[Doxygen documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cutlass) provides a complete list of files, classes, 
and template concepts defined in the CUTLASS project.

A detailed explanation of the source code organization may be found in the 
[CUTLASS documentation](media/docs/code_organization.md), but several main components are summarized below.

```

### Test

The `test/unit/` directory consist of unit tests implemented with Google Test that demonstrate
basic usage of Core API components and complete tests of the CUTLASS GEMM computations.

Instructions for building and running the Unit tests are described in the [Quickstart guide](media/docs/quickstart.md).

# Performance Profiling

The `tools/profiler/` directory contains a command-line utility for launching each of the GEMM kernels.
It can be built as follows:

```
$ make cutlass_profiler -j
```

To limit compilation time, only one tile size is instantiated for each data type, math instruction, and layout.
To instantiate all, set the following environment variable when running CMake from an empty `build/` directory.
```
$ cmake .. -DCUTLASS_NVCC_ARCHS=75 -DCUTLASS_LIBRARY_KERNELS=all
...
$ make cutlass_profiler -j
```

Example command line for profiling SGEMM kernels is as follows:
```
$ ./tools/profiler/cutlass_profiler --kernels=sgemm --m=4352 --n=4096 --k=4096
