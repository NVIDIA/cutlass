Overview
===========================

CUTLASS 4.x bridges the gap between productivity and performance for CUDA kernel development. 
By providing Python-based DSLs to the powerful CUTLASS C++ template library, it enables 
faster iteration, easier prototyping, and a gentler learning curve for high-performance linear 
algebra on NVIDIA GPUs.

Overall we envision CUTLASS DSLs as a family of domain-specific languages (DSLs). 
With the release of 4.0, we are releasing the first of these in CuTe DSL. 
This is a low level programming model that is fully consistent with CuTe C++ abstractions — exposing 
core concepts such as layouts, tensors, hardware atoms, and full control over the hardware thread and data hierarchy.

Why CUTLASS DSLs?
============================

While CUTLASS offers exceptional performance through its C++ template abstractions, the complexity 
can present challenges for many developers. CUTLASS 4.x addresses this by:

- **Simplifying metaprogramming**: Metaprogramming in Python is a lot more intuitive than with C++
- **Accelerating Iteration**: Rapid prototyping with familiar Python syntax and blazing fast compile times
- **Lowering Barriers**: Reduced learning curve for GPU programming concepts and consistency between CuTe C++ and DSL
- **Maintaining Performance**: Generated code leverages optimized CUTLASS primitives

Students can learn GPU programming concepts without the complexity of C++ templates. 
Researchers and performance engineers can rapidly explore algorithms, prototype, and tune 
kernels before moving to production implementations.

Key Concepts and Approach
================================

CUTLASS DSLs translate Python code into a custom intermediate representation (IR), 
which is then Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled into optimized CUDA kernels using MLIR and `ptxas`.

Core CuTe DSL Abstractions
-----------------------------------

- **Layouts** – Describe how data is organized in memory and across threads.
- **Tensors** – Combine data pointers or iterators with layout metadata.
- **Atoms** – Represent fundamental hardware operations like matrix multiply-accumulate (MMA) or memory copy.
- **Tiled Operations** – Define how atoms are applied across thread blocks and warps (e.g., ``TiledMma``, ``TiledCopy``).

For more on CuTe abstractions, refer to the `CuTe C++ library documentation <https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/main/media/docs/cute/00_quickstart.md>`__.

**Pythonic Kernel Expression**

Developers express kernel logic, data movement, and computation using familiar Python syntax and control flow.

The DSLs simplify expressing loop tiling, threading strategies, and data transformations using concise Python code.

**JIT Compilation**

Python kernels are compiled at runtime into CUDA device code using MLIR infrastructure and NVIDIA’s ``ptxas`` toolchain, 
enabling rapid iteration and interactive debugging.

Relationship to CUTLASS C++
=================================

CUTLASS DSLs are not a replacement for the CUTLASS C++ library or its 2.x and 3.x APIs. Instead, it aims to be a high-productivity kernel 
authoring framework that shares all concepts with CUTLASS 3.x C++ API such as CuTe, pipelines, schedulers etc.

- **Performance**: Generated kernels aim to match CUTLASS C++ kernels in performance; however, some performance gaps 
  may exist due to missing optimizations that have been added over the years to CUTLASS C++ and may be missing in the DSLs examples.
- **Library**: The CUTLASS DSLs do not currently ship with a full GEMM/Conv autotuning profiler or library interface 
  akin to CUTLASS C++. Instead, it focuses on generating and autotuning individual kernel instances (for example: via tile size exploration) and via native integration DL frameworks that support auto-tuning.
