/*

This example shows fusing two GEMM mainloops into one kernel. The first GEMM computes relu(alpha*A*B) and 
the second GEMM computes relu(alpha*A*B+beta*C). The performance measuring environment compares against
two unfused GEMM operations, demonstrating a speedup of the fused kernel on the 
NVIDIA Turing GPU architecture.

Problem size:
  GEMM1 (M,N,K): 128*1600, 64, 576
  GEMM2 (M,N,K): 128*1600, 128, 64

Note that GEMM1_N = GEMM2_K

The example requires the number of threadblocks be the same across 2 GEMMs and 
thread_block_tile_N = problem_N so the data required by each layer is threadblock-resident. It 
also requires warp_tile_N = thread_block_tile_N so the data required by each warp is 
register-file-resident.

Performance:
  - fp16 on Tesla T4 @ 1590MHz (non-fused vs. fused): 1.39011 ms vs. 1.26035 ms
  - int8 on Tesla T4 @ 1590MHz (non-fused vs. fused): 0.751759 ms vs. 0.62971 ms
  - fp16 on Quadro RTX 8000 @ 1890MHz (non-fused vs. fused): 0.721144 ms vs. 0.629864 ms
  - int8 on Quadro RTX 8000 @ 1890MHz (non-fused vs. fused): 0.379049 ms vs. 0.324764 ms
  - int8 on GA100 @ 1200MHz (non-fused vs. fused): 0.153795 ms vs. 0.129874 ms
