    "## Understanding GEMM\n",
    "\n",
    "GEMM is one of the most important operations in linear algebra and deep learning. Given two 2D tensors A with shape $(M, K)$ and B with shape $(N, K)$, the GEMM operation $C = A \\times B$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "    C_{i,j} = \\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} A_{i,k} * B_{j,k}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a 2D tensor C with shape $(M, N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $i \\in [0, M)$ represents the row index of $A$ and $C$\n",
    "- $j \\in [0, N)$ represents the column index of $C$ and the row index of $B$\n",
    "- $k \\in [0, K)$ repersents the column index of $A$ and $B$\n",
    "- $A_{i,k}$, $B_{j,k}$, and $C_{i,j}$ are the elements at position $(i,k)$, $(j,k)$ and $(i,j)$ in tensors $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation has several important characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parallelizable**: Each element can be computed independently. It helps take fully use of SMs in a GPU.\n",
    "2. **Data Reusable**: $C_{i,:}$-s (The row $i$ of $C$) need the same data from $A_{i,:}$ while $C_{:,j}$-s (The column $j$ of $C$) need the same data from $B_{:,j}$. This data reuse pattern can help reduce the IO pressure\n",
    "3. **Block-friendly**: A block of elements can be processed together. Each block is a sub-problem of the whole GEMM. It helps reduce the IO pressure for each SM. It gives possibility to accelerate the computation using MMA instructions.\n",
    "4. **Bottleneck-flexible**: Unlike the elementwise_add, the bottleneck for GEMM is varied for different problem sizes. Let's calculate the compute/memory ratio for GEMM roughly: $ratio = \\frac{M * N * K}{M*K + N*K + M*N} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{1}{M} + \\frac{1}{K}}$.\n",
    "It's related to all M, N and K. To reach good enough perf, we need different strategies for different problem sizes accordingly.\n",

    "First of all, we need to set basic configurations.\n",

    "- io_dtype: The datatype for tensors $A$, $B$, and $C$. For the most cases, it's also the input datatype of mma instructions (there're some exceptions, e.g. TF32 datatype, input transformation, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- acc_dtype: The datatype for the accumulation. Normally, set it as FP32 to avoid overflow. As C's datatype could be different from acc_dtype, the acc data needs to be converted to io_dtype before storing out.\n",
    "\n",
    "- mma_inst_shape_mnk: The shape of one tcgen05 mma instruction can deal with. See more details in [PTX Document 9.7.16.2.1. Matrix Shape](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-matrix-shape).\n",
    "From beginning, we choose the biggest one as it's easy to reach SOL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- mma_tiler_mnk: The GEMM kernel is normally implemented as blocked GEMM (see figure 1). Mma tiler is the block shape that one CTA or two CTAs will process. Whether one or two is determined by the issue granularity of tcgen05. See more details in [PTX Document 9.7.16.5. Issue Granularity](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-issue-granularity).\n",
    "From beginning, we choose one CTA to issue tcgen05 for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- threads_per_cta: The number of threads we need to use in one CTA. To take fully use of a SM (streaming multiprocessor), it's at least 128.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ab_stages: The number demonstrates how many blocks that TMA can load before each block's computation. It's usually limited by the smem capacity. For mma_tiler_mnk (128, 256, 64), we can set it as 4 at most.\n",
    "\n",
    "- acc_stage: As each CTA only computes one block of acc and stores out, the number is 1.\n",

    "## Structure of the Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's breakdown how a GEMM kernel organize:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prologue**: The phase before the first MMA instructions. It usually defines, fetches, allocates, partitions or calculates necessary components (listed below). What else, load multiple stages of data ahead of the first MMA to help hide GMEM latency.\n",
    "   - Indexing\n",
    "     * `block_idx` (bidx, bidy): Block index in the grid\n",
    "     * `mma_coord_mnk`: The location of which block the current MMA unit will calculate (see details in figure 1)\n",
    "     * `thread_idx` (tidx): Thread index within a block (0 to threads_per_cta - 1). We need this to slice the partition of tensor memory for each thread in a block (see details in [PTX Document 9.7.16.2.3.1 Memory Layout](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/parallel-thread-execution/#tcgen05-memory-layout))\n",
    "     * `warp_idx`: As TMA & tcgen05.mma only needs one thread to issue, some code only needs to execute by warp 0\n",
    "   - Allocation\n",
    "     * `smem` (storage, sA, sB): Allocate necessary smem usage for pipelines, A/B smem tensors as input of tcgen05.mma\n",
    "     * `tmem`: Allocate necessary tmem usage for Acc\n",
    "   - Pipeline (see more details in async_pipeline.ipynb)\n",
    "     * `PipelineTmaUmma`: Tma & tcgen05.mma units are async. PipelineTmaUmma helps notify: 1. tcgen05.mma when TMA fills A/B buffers to full; 2. TMA when tcgen05.mma consumes A/B buffer to empty\n",
    "     * `PipelineUmmaAsync`: It helps threads when tcgen05.mma finish the accumulation and Acc is ready\n",
    "     * `Barrier initialization`: barrier initialization work is done inside the pipeline create functions\n",
    "   - Partition\n",
    "     * `local_tile`: Get the block of A/B/C GMEM tensors for current MMA unit acoording to `mma_coord_mnk`.\n",
    "     * `TMA`: Get the tensor view from each TMA instruction\n",
    "     * `MMA`: Get the tensor view from each tcgen05.mma instruction\n",
    "   - TMA descriptor prefetch\n",
    "     * `cpasync.prefetch_descriptor`: helps shorten the latency of access tma descrptor, i.e. tma_atom_a, tma_atom_b\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mainloop**: The phase that carries out the main computation of GEMM. It's usually organized as a loop to iterate blocks in K dim for accumulation. The loop body contains:\n",
    "    - `Data prefetch` with a fixed stride (ab_stage - 1) ahead of current K block\n",
    "    - `MMA computation` for current K block\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Epilogue**: The phase after the MMA instructions finish the accumulation. It usually contains:\n",
    "    - `Partition`: Get the tensor views from epi tiler (acc subtile) & each tcgen05.ld instruction\n",
    "    - `Acc fetch`: Load data from tensor memory to register\n",
    "    - `Fusion & datatype conversion`: Fuse some operations on C (optional); Datatype conversion if output type is different from acc type\n",
    "    - `Relinquish tmem alloc permit`: Give permit for following launched kernels\n",
    "    - `Storing`: TMA or st.global to store out\n",
    "    - `TMEM deallocation`: Deallocate tmem for Acc buffer\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Usually, we subtile the acc buffer to save resources of registers & smem (if using TMA to store C). For our mma_tiler (128, 256), each thread needs 256 registers if no subtiling. Besides, better instruction-level parallelism for interleavely issuing tcgen05.ld, data conversion & st.global.\n",
