    "\n",
    "This tutorial explores advanced CUDA programming techniques for implementing efficient producer-consumer \n",
    "patterns using asynchronous communication primitives in the CuTe Domain Specific Language (DSL).\n",

    "## Foundation: Inter-Warp Communication Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding CUDA Warps and Shared Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "A **warp** is the fundamental execution unit in CUDA, consisting of 32 threads that execute instructions in Single Instruction, \n",
    "Multiple Thread (SIMT) fashion on a Streaming Multiprocessor (SM). Understanding warp-level programming is crucial for \n",
    "achieving optimal GPU performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- Warps execute in lockstep, making them ideal for SIMD operations\n",
    "- Multiple warps within a thread block (CTA) can cooperate through shared memory\n",
    "- Shared memory provides low-latency, high-bandwidth communication between threads\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shared Memory Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shared memory** serves as a programmer-managed cache with several important characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Speed**: ~100x faster than global memory access\n",
    "- **Scope**: Accessible by all threads within the same thread block\n",
    "- **Organization**: Divided into banks (typically 32) to enable parallel access\n",
    "- **Conflicts**: Bank conflicts occur when multiple threads access the same bank simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traditional Synchronous Communication\n",
    "\n",
    "The conventional approach for inter-warp communication relies on explicit synchronization barriers. The following sequence diagram \n",
    "illustrates the typical producer-consumer pattern:\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Problem with Synchronous Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous example demonstrates traditional synchronized communication between warps. While functional, this approach \n",
    "has significant performance limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Section Analysis:**\n",
    "- **First `__syncthreads()`**: Ensures data is written and ready for consumption\n",
    "- **Second `__syncthreads()`**: Guarantees data has been consumed and memory can be safely overwritten\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Impact:**\n",
    "- All warps are forced into lockstep execution\n",
    "- No computational overlap between producer and consumer operations\n",
    "- Wasted cycles as warps wait at synchronization barriers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hopper Architecture: Enabling Asynchronous Primitives\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the Hopper architecture, CUDA introduced sophisticated asynchronous communication primitives that enable \n",
    "**warp specialization**â€”allowing different warps to perform distinct, specialized roles while maintaining loose coupling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Overlapped Execution**: Producer and consumer warps can perform computations concurrently\n",
    "- **Reduced Latency**: Eliminates unnecessary synchronization stalls\n",
    "- **Better Resource Utilization**: Maximizes SM occupancy and throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "### Async Pipeline Communication Pattern\n",

    "- **`PipelineProducer.commit(PipelineProducer.ImmutableProducerHandle)`** / **`PipelineProducer.ImmutableProducerHandle.commit()`**: Signals that data has been written to the handle-pointed slot and is ready for consumption\n",
    "  - Triggers waiting consumers\n",
    "  - Maintains data consistency guarantees\n",
    "  - If no assigned handle, **`PipelineConsumerHandle.release()`** tracks its internal maintained handle (pointed to the last one it acquires)\n",

    "- **Consumer**: Can execute post-processing, result computation, or output operations while producer prepares next data\n",

    "#### Enhanced API Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`PipelineProducer.advance()`**: Moves the producer's write index to the next buffer slot\n",
    "  - Enables round-robin buffer allocation\n",
    "  - Allows producer to continue without waiting for all previous data to be consumed\n",
    "  - Can be conducted implicitly when calling **`PipelineProducer.require_and_advance()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`PipelineConsumer.advance()`**: Moves the consumer's read index to the next buffer slot\n",
    "  - Maintains proper ordering of data consumption\n",
    "  - Signals availability of processed slots\n",
    "  - Can be conducted implicitly when calling **`PipelineConsumer.wait_and_advance()`**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`PipelineProducer.ImmutableResourceHandle.index`** / **`PipelineConsumer.ImmutableResourceHandle.index`**: Returns pointed buffer slot index\n",
    "  - Used for addressing specific staging buffer locations\n",
    "  - Enables direct slot-based data access\n",
