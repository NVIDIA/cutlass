/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/torch/_tensor.py:1744: UserWarning: Accessing the data pointer of FakeTensor is deprecated and will error in PyTorch 2.5. This is almost definitely a bug in your code and will cause undefined behavior with subsystems like torch.compile. Please wrap calls to tensor.data_ptr() in an opaque custom op; If all else fails, you can guard accesses to tensor.data_ptr() on isinstance(tensor, FakeTensor). (Triggered internally at /pytorch/c10/core/StorageImpl.cpp:34.)
  return torch.to_dlpack(self)
