"""
A Latex Printing Example using CuTe DSL.

This example prints latex for a given layout or thread value layout.

The primary goal for this example is to demonstrate how to dump latex, which can then be
turned into an image in your favorite latex compiler.

To run this example:

.. code-block:: bash

    python examples/python/CuteDSL/cute/print_latex.py
    python examples/python/CuteDSL/cute/print_latex.py --tv_layout

To compile, pipe the output to a file and use a tool like pdflatex:

.. code-block:: bash
    python examples/python/CuTeDSL/cute/print_latex.py > latex.tex
    pdflatex latex.tex
"""


@cute.jit
def main(print_tv_layout: cutlass.Constexpr[bool]):
    # Note: only support compile time printing layouts
    if cutlass.const_expr(print_tv_layout):
        thr_layout = cute.make_ordered_layout((4, 32), order=(1, 0))
        val_layout = cute.make_ordered_layout((4, 1), order=(1, 0))
        tiler_mn, tv_layout = cute.make_layout_tv(thr_layout, val_layout)
        print_latex_tv(tv_layout, tiler_mn)
    else:
        layout = cute.make_layout((10, 10))
        print_latex(layout)

    parser.add_argument("--tv_layout", action="store_true")
