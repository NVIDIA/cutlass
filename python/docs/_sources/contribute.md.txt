# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the CUTLASS Python interface. Based on the type of contribution, it will fall into two categories:

1. You want to report a bug, feature request, or documentation issue
    - File an [issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/issues/new/choose) describing what you encountered or what you want to see changed.
    - The CUTLASS team will evaluate the issues and triage them, scheduling them for a release. If you believe the issue needs priority attention, comment on the issue to notify the team.
2. You want to implement a feature or bug-fix
    - We welcome contributions from the community. We recommend that you contribute via a [pull request](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/pulls). If you have questions about CUTLASS, consider asking a question via the [Discussions](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/discussions) tab.
